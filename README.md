# Satellite-image-classification

## Abstract : 
Satellite image classification using predictive analytics is a significant task with 
numerous applications in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster 
management. This project aims to develop accurate models for classifying satellite 
images into distinct categories such as 'cloudy', 'desert', 'green area', and 'water'. By 
leveraging predictive analytics techniques, the project addresses the challenge of 
automatically analysing satellite images and assigning them to the correct class.

The methodology employed in this project involves a combination of image processing 
techniques, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms. Initially, the satellite 
images undergo pre-processing to enhance their quality and eliminate any noise or 
artifacts. Relevant features are then extracted from the images to capture the distinctive 
characteristics of each land cover class. These features serve as inputs to various 
machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree classifier, 
support vector machines, KNN classifier, Naive Bayes classifier, and random forest 
classifier.

The project consists of several experiments to evaluate the performance of the 
classification algorithms. A dataset of satellite images, organized into subfolders 
representing different land cover classes, is divided into training and testing sets. The 
training set is utilized to train the models, while the testing set is used to assess their 
performance. Each algorithm is trained using the training set, and predictions are made 
on the testing set. The accuracy of each algorithm is measured by comparing the 
predicted labels with the true labels from the testing set.
